HOW TO USE A PATCH TO UPGRADE THE DRUPAL CODEBASE

	THE PATCH METHOD (simplest way).  Saves any changes you've made to core modules. (not officially supported by drupal)

	1. Go to buildamodule.com/core-patches (redirect to site)
	2. Download and save the patch file
	3. Put the patch in site root folder
	4. Make sure working directory is clean, make any commits that may need to be made.
	5. Create a new branch "git checkout -b feature_upgrade"
	6. cd to site root
	7. Dry run patch to check for errors. patch -p1 --dry-run < [patch-file.patch]
	8. Run patch. patch -p1 < [patch-file.patch]
		- Can run diff to see what was changed
	9. git add modules/*
	10. git add themes/*
	11. git commit -a -m "Upgraded Drupal from drupal from 7.7 to 7.8"
	12. rm patch file from root

HOW TO UPGRADE DRUPAL THE TRADITIONAL WAY

	1. Download latest version of Drupal. (expand tar and copy it one level above root)
	2. cp -R drupal-7.8/* (the latest version) drupal-7.8/.htaccess [site file (ie /rlcdev)]
	3. Review and commit changes.

HOW TO COMPLETE A MINOR UPGRADE

	1. Reports > Status Report
	2. Run database update script
	3. Apply updates
	4. Test the site for changes.
	5. Update manual-updates.txt file "Run the update script (drupal was updated from drupal [version] to [version]"
	6. git commit -a -m "MANUAL UPDATE. Added note to manual-updates.txt file"
	7. Checkout develop
	8. Merge feature branch with develop: git merge --no-ff feature-upgrade-[version]
	9. Delete feature branch: git branch -d feature-upgrade-[version]
	10. git push
